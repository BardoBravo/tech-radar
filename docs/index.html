<h3>Team Card - Content Bravo</h3>

<p>
Adapting Zalando Tech Radar using <em>ring assignment</em> as our basis to define our skill level as a team. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NOOB</strong> &mdash; New skill to the team, requiring significant guidance.</li>
<li><strong>BEGINNERS</strong> &mdash; Team possess basic skills, but still need support and guidance.</li>
<li><strong>PROS</strong> &mdash; Highly proficient and independent in the team regarding those skills.</li>
<li><strong>REFERENCE</strong> &mdash; Team is an authority in those fields, offering deep expertise and guidance.</li>
</ul>

</td><td>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
  A team skill matrix, represented through a skill card matrix, serves to assess the skills of team members, identify gaps, and allocate resources effectively. By visually displaying each member's skills, it facilitates planning for development initiatives and succession, enabling managers to match tasks with individuals' expertise. Additionally, it fosters collaboration and communication by aiding in identifying key contributors and promoting knowledge sharing. Furthermore, it provides a basis for performance evaluation, ensuring alignment with organizational goals and maximizing team effectiveness through strategic skill management.
</p>

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
The Tech Radar is maintained by our <em>Development Team</em> itself &mdash; It comes from team self evaluation and feedback from other teams.<br/>
</p>

<em>BTW, if you would like to create your own Team Matrix &mdash; we have <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">open sourced the code</a> to generate this visualization.</em>
